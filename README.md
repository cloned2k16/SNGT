#### (sing it) meant to be, the entry point to a completely new iNET Social Media paradigm 
> ## key features
> - Privacy & Security first
> - Open & Extensible  
> - Flexible & Resilient
> - No 'company policy rules' to comply with
> - You always own your data and only you decide what, when and to who you share it ..
> -

this will be just the first application   
 built around a completely new iNET paradigm ..

#### How it works ..
well, despite may seems a much too ambitious project  
it's actually not .. and  
despite may seems to be way too complex to afford without huge investments   
can be done by just using common internet protocols in place for decades  
in a different architectural paradigm ..  
and scale it up on the run  without worry too much about scalability at any point ..  
( no cloud bulshit either .. )

the key is actually
only about the architecture and strategy of said system  
which can be defined simplistically  
(and to give an idea of it) as  
P2MPN (point to multipoint network)
  
#### 'Company' Vision Statement ..
>- **NO MONOPOLY**    
   no social platform on iNET should be alowed to have full control of itself,  
   just like nobody can monopolize telephones or whatever public communication infrastructure & tools 
>- **PRIVACY**  
   you are not the product, and the monetization must be done under strict conditions of fair play,  
   (seems obvious , while obviously is not today)  
   aside, your data is yours!! and forever , no matter what ..  
>- **NO CONTROL**  
   it's none of our business to replace police work ..  
>- **DECENTRALIZED**  
   serverless is on hype now but make confusion with cloud computing  
   while 'we' are inspired by the very principle of original iNET instead  
   so decentralized means just that, which BTW is a garantee we have no control over you ..
